=== Version 2.0 ===

- Complete restructuration of the algorithm (almost the same functioning but way easier to understand).
- Implementation of the "number-of-plans" parameter.
- Autodectect plan can detect as many plans as specified by "number-of-plans"
- If autodetect can't detect the good number of plan, will ajust the parameter "number-of-plans" to match.
- Suppression of "plan1", "plan2", "plan3" parameters.
- Creation of the parameter "plans".
- "plans" replace the "plan1" "plan2" "plan3"


Note: This changes are major, all applications using previous version of the plugin should be adapted.
